# GPGC API

<p>This is a Rails API that allows you to retrieve all music contributions made by me, Gabriel Pessoa Guerra Cavalcanti. You can access all albums, aliases (artists), songs, collaborations, and soundtracks I've worked on.</p>

<p> It also works as a Discogs-esque API for those who want to create a catalog too (You may skip the seeds in case you want to make it on your own) </p>


## Versions :gem:
* **Ruby:** 3.1.0
* **Rails:** 6.0.3

#### Setup the API :monorail:

1. Run `bundle install` to install all the dependencies of the project;
2. Rename `config/database.yml.example` to `config/database.yml` and add your database credentials;
3. Set up `.env.development`, `.env.test` and your `.env.production` (in case you're trying to deploy) accordingly to your `config/database.yml` file.
3. Run `rake setup` to create the database and apply the migrations and seeds;
4. You will be asked to created an `user` with an username and password.
5. Run `rspec` to check for tests;
6. Run `rails s` and go for your localhost

## Docker :whale:

<p>This is a 100% dockerized application!</p>

#### Docker steps reminders

- Start terminal
- Make sure of permissions of your OS and terminal system are on point. (Don't be afraid to change the shebang in case you need)
- Make sure each of your `.env` host is set as `db`
- You will be asked to created an `user` with an username and password.
- If you're loading your environment variable from `.env.production` you can always write "production" after the shell scripts. 
- If you're not installing for the first time, don't overwrite archives
- If you're installing a new gem, be always sure to rebuild.


### Build the container and start the DB


```bash
cd gpgc-api
  sh devops/chmod.sh
  ./devops/compose/build.sh --no-cache
  ./devops/compose/up.sh
  ./devops/rails/restart.sh
  ./devops/compose/exec.sh
        bundle
        rspec
        exit
  ./devops/compose/down.sh
  exit
```

### Install swagger dependencies

```bash
cd gpgc-api
  ./devops/compose/up.sh
  ./devops/swagger/install.sh
  exit
```

### Run Rails server

```bash
cd gpgc-api
    ./devops/compose/up.sh
    ./devops/rails/server.sh
    # CTRL + C
    ./devops/compose/down.sh
  exit
```

### Update DB and Rails

```bash
cd gpgc-api
    ./devops/compose/up.sh
    ./devops/rails/update.sh
    ./devops/compose/down.sh
  exit
```

### Uninstall

- These scripts aren't environment sensitive, so there's no need for `production` argument, although you mind find environment variables defined in the code to avoid warn messages.

```bash
cd gpgc-api
  ./devops/compose/down.sh
  ./devops/compose/delete.sh
  exit
```

## DB reminders

- If you're having trouble when opening on a DB management system (like Beekeeper, DBeaver, PG Admin, etc.), don't forget that you need to run the container and use `localhost` as your host. 
- If any role issues appear Don't be afraid to `pkill postgres` and `brew services stop postgresql` (If you're running in homebrew).
- If you are having trouble with users accessing the DB, rebuild the container.


## Request cURLs

- Use `discovery` folder to get example of cURLs for requests.
